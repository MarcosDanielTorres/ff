# Get the version
# build it jaaaaaa
a new version of asssimp may break the version im using on my engine!

so i could:
- first try to build that version
- ignore what ive done in my engine and proceed reading the animation book and use that version
  instead! this will take a lot of time!
- Upgrade my engine to the version of the books and then everything will have the same vesrion. then build

This last one is probably what i should do! Maybe even use the same version as the vulkan book or maybe one that is 
close enough

will go with: "Upgrade my engine to the version of the books and then everything will have the same version"

I mean... I can even go with using cmake for the building. Which actually should be better
the problem with this is that i have to use compatible command line args for building my engine

Plan: Upgrade engine and see if it works, using cmake separate the assimp building to another folder (is almost done),
put it here and test! (test with my engine code)
