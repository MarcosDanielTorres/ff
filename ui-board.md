# Introduction!
Here are the possible changes for the UI

-- Fonts --
DONE render a letter
    - get the pixel info of a letter 
    - put it into a texture
    - show it
DONE render all alphabets letter (A-z)
DONE use uvs to show specific letters!
DONE implement the push_text function for strings
    (not account for multiline strings at the moment)
DONE use all the glyphs
TODO take extensive notes!
TODO cleanup the texture atlas logic (names, codepoints and glyphs logic, etc)

-- UI -- 
TODO the ui componenets structs, functions, initializers are all over the place!
TODO make it so the commands are not persistent each frame! Not really immediate
TODO change ui ortho matrix for 2D alternative (my own)
