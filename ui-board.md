# Introduction!
Here are the possible changes for the UI

In order:
DONE render a letter
    - get the pixel info of a letter 
    - put it into a texture
    - show it
DONE render all alphabets letter (A-z)
TODO use uvs to show specific letters!
TODO change ui ortho matrix for 2D alternative (my own)
TODO the ui componenets structs, functions, initializers are all over the place!

TODO use all the glyphs


- Debug and see if result.width == 1102 and result.height == 580. And check other things!
- Paste it into a .bmp
