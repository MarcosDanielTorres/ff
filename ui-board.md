# Introduction!
Here are the possible changes for the UI

In order:
DONE render a letter
    - get the pixel info of a letter 
    - put it into a texture
    - show it
DONE render all alphabets letter (A-z)
DONE use uvs to show specific letters!
DONE implement the push_text function for strings
    (not account for multiline strings at the moment)
TODO use all the glyphs
TODO change ui ortho matrix for 2D alternative (my own)
TODO the ui componenets structs, functions, initializers are all over the place!
