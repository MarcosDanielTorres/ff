# Introduction!
Here are the possible changes for the UI

In order:
DONE render a letter
    - get the pixel info of a letter 
    - put it into a texture
    - show it
TODO use uvs now to show the glyph!
TODO change ui ortho matrix for 2D alternative (my own)
TODO the ui componenets structs, functions, initializers are all over the place!



- Debug and see if result.width == 1102 and result.height == 580. And check other things!
- Paste it into a .bmp
